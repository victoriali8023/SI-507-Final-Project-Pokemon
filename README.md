# SI-507-Final-Project-Pokemon

This is a project for you to find the most suitable pokemon by inputting options.</br>
Step 1: You could input your name, type and size of pokemon you like, your lucky number, and the language you want for the ability name*.</br>
Step 2: After these inputs, you could submit the form and get a profile of the pokemon which is generated by the given information.</br>
Step 3: If you choose English, you can check how rare your pokemon's ability is by clicking the link next to the name of the ability.</br>
Step 4: If you are not satisfied with the pokemon generated for you, you could choose again and back to home page.</br>
Step 5: There are two links for you to check the overall ability and size distribution, which are displayed in pie diagram and bar graph seperately.</br>

*If you choose Chinese or Japanese, you cannot check the rarity of your pokemon's ability in the profile page.
